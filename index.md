I am a first year computer science major at CSUF and I actually plan on changing my major, however exploring Computer Science and finding out whether it was right for me was an enjoyable experience nontheless.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 6 Part 2

This was a fun lab because I thought it was cool to use C++ to create a card game. In this case we created a black jack simulator and got to explore using boolean values as a true or false indicator. I enjoy card games so this lab stuck with me and reminded me why I enjoy programs.

* Lab 08 Part 2

This lab was also one of my favorites due to its light workload. It was a lab that came easy to me and also a lab that wasnâ€™t very time consuming. I used a counter to loop lines and the overall output was unique and different from my previous labs. This was the first lab where I did most of my own work so it felt accomplishing to complete this lab.

* Lab 01

Lastly, Lab one was one of my favorites this year. It was a very easy lab but was kinda funny to me since almost nobody had linux installed. It was my first experience with group coding.
